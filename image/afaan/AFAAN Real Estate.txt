AFAAN Real Estate
Project Role: Logo, Brand Identity
Project Timeline: Two weeks

The identity for AFAAN combines sophistication and approachability through rich tones, modern typography, and a logo where the "A" represents a door, while diamond shapes draw inspiration from Arabic script. This design symbolizes new opportunities and stability, aligning perfectly with AFAAN’s focus on offering budget luxury homes that deliver both quality and value.
